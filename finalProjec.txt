#Idea:
-I have an Italian Investor who wants to open an Italian restaurant in New York and he is looking for the best neighborhood for his restaurant.
-The idea is to find a neighborhood who doesn't have lots of Italian Restaurants and is also quite central.
-His ideal neighborhood would be one which is central , doesn't have a lot of Italian restaurants and accessible to everyone.


#Data:
-I have access to New York data which has the different neighborhoods and their longitude and latitude.
-First I will use this data with the FourSquare API to try to find the neighborhoods with the least number of Italian restaurants 
-Then I will create a folium map of it and show it to the investor.
-Then I will cluster them to see which neighborhoods are simmilar so he could get a better idea
